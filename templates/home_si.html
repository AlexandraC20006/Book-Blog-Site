<h1>Welcome to my book site!</h1>

<p class="home">This is just a little place for me to log what books I've read and rate them out of 5 and stuff. 
    "ALL BOOKS" just has all the books, "AUTHORS" has all the authors which have a book on the site, 
    linking to pages with those books, and "GENRES" is just like authors but... 
    genres rather than authors I guess. Anyways enjoy. Scroll down to sign out.
